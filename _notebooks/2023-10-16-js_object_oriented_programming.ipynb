    "- Classes are the building blocks of object oriented programming\n",
    "- Classes can be used to help organize your code\n",
    "    - Instead of looking through a 1000 line file of code to figure out what needs to be changed to make your dog walk to the left rather than to the right, you can just look in your 50 line class for dog and know exactly what needs to be changed\n",
    "- Having organization in your code will make it so anyone can easily start working on your project with you\n",
    "- Classes make it so you can reuse your code\n",
    "    - Instead of coding 20 cats from scracth to add to your cat daycare app you can define a cat class and make 20 cat instances quickly"
